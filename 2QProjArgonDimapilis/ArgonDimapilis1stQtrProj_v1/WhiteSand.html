		<p>About Manila Bay White Sand<br>
		MANILA-- Malacañang corrected Friday reports that natural white sand was being used to cover the baywalk of the Manila Bay, saying "crushed dolomite boulders" were being utilized.<br>

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said he received information from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources on the use of crushed sedimentary rocks--which appear like white sand, for the rehabilitation project.<br>

"...Per the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the report that 'white sand' is being used to fill the stretch of the baywalk is erroneous," Roque said in a statement.<br>
He added that funds for the program were already allocated even before the pandemic started.<br>

Environmental groups such as Greenpeace have criticized the dumping of synthetic white sand in the baywalk as an unnecessary part of the government's Manila Bay clean up program.<br>

Environment Undersecretary Benny Antiporda however said the project was meant to bring the beach experience closer to Filipinos who could not travel.<br>

“Kung hindi man sila makapunta ng Boracay, Bohol, Palawan, or Cebu, itong mga kababayan sa Maynila, ilalapit natin sa kanila ang white sand dito sa baywalk area,” Antiporda told ABS-CBN News on Thursday.<br>

(If they could not go to Boracay, Bohol, Palawan, or Cebu, we can bring the white sand experience closer to those here in Manila.)<br>
As the Philippines moves to reinvigorate tourism, Roque said the national government is already in coordination with local government units on the resumption of travel.<br>
"We must, however, emphasize that there must be proper and close coordination between the national government and the LGUs regarding the implementation of health and safety protocols when traveling," he said.<br>
